RAYCASTING

simulate the way the light rays interact with objects in 3D

calculte how far a ray travels before it hits something: step size + length
	si dir.x < 0
		step.x = -1
		length.x = (start.x - check.x) * unit.x 
	dir.x = cos(angle) | dir.y = sin(angle)
	start.x.y = position du joueur
	unit.x = sqrt(1 + pow(dir.y / dir.x, 2))
	check.x = (int)start.x  => float de base
